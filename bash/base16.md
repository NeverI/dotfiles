How can I lunch the terminal with a specified theme?
===
    Add '''--window-with-profile="Base 16 Eighties Dark"''' to the terminal luncher

There is an easy way to register all theme?
===
    '''
    for f in ~/.config/dotfiles/bash/plugins/base16-gnome/*.sh;
        source f;
    done
    '''

    run this script in the terminal and all theme will be available in profile selection

My favorite themes:
===
    - eighties.dark
    - monokail.dark
    - pop.dark
